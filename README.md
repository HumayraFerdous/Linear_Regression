# Linear_Regression
This repository contains a set of Python files focusing only on Linear Regression (Machine Learning). The datasets are different, and all are collected from Kaggle. 

Linear regression is a type of supervised machine-learning algorithm that learns from the labelled datasets and maps the data points with the most optimized linear functions. It can be used for prediction on new datasets. It computes the linear relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation with observed data. It predicts the continuous output variables based on the independent input variable. The primary goal of linear regression is to find the best-fit line, which is the difference between the predicted values and actual values, and this difference has to be kept minimum.
